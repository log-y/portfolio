        <h1>Hi, I'm Logan</h1>
        <p class="short-text">I'm a CS and math major at Tufts University.
            I have proven experience in data science and software engineering through
            previous internships and research positions. 
            I like to build projects in React, Django, and PyTorch.
            When I'm not coding, you can find me working out, hiking, or gaming.

                        <p>GailBot is an audio transcription tool that accounts for
                             the paralinguistic features of audio (like
                            voice intonation, prosody, etc). The API software was an award-winning
                            breakthrough in human interaction, winning the Sage Concepts Grant Award ($20,000)
                            and being published in a prestigious journal, Dialogue and Discourse.
                            Me and my team are working on the GailBot project to further expand its functionality.
                            We are building a whole ecosystem around GailBot, allowing 
                            for other developers to build and share their own machine learning
                            plugins and distribute them to other users.
                            We built a completely new website for uploads and downloads
                            of these plugins using React and AWS.
                            We are also working on a Python package (published to PyPI)
                            where people can access developer tools to continue building
                            their plugins.

                        <p>When people design any product that involves running 
                            fluids through a porous surface (like air filters, 
                            athletic wear, or a sprinkler), they
                            like to keep track of a number of factors that will dictate
                            how that fluid will run (like the surface's surface area, roughness,
                            waviness). One particular factor they like to measure is 'tortuosity', a measure
                            for how 'complex' a fluid's path will be from one end of the surface
                            to the other. My goal was to use one of the university's datasets (
                                a collection of labeled images
                            )
                            to help predict that tortuosity. I mainly used a convolutional
                            neural network (using PyTorch) for this, looking at the images
                            pixel-by-pixel. But I also used lighter models, too, like linear
                            regression models and decision trees. All in all, a super fun
                            introduction to the field!

                            on a thousand hours of the CommonVoice English dataset. I also showcased it in a 
                            Django web app, so you can see how the model 'thinks' about its input!

                            and spend $25 training it in the cloud. I then incorporated

                        <p>I worked in a 12-person team following the Agile methodology. We constructed a
                            web application in React, MongoDB, and Tailwind that would collect data from 
                            the users and run it through a set of analytics to display to the company's administrators.
                            This was a cool introduction to the field of software development! My tasks were usually
                            in the space of working on CRUD operaitons and HTTP requests to our database.
